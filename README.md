## PacMan

The project is creating by two students during "Python" curse at AGH UST. We are following the shedule, which is made in Polish. 

At the end, it will be an aplication, based on well-known game "Pac-man", created in Python using PyGame library. We have already created the app to making new boards. In following weeks we will add the main game symulator as it was described in shedule.
